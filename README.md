This is the content for the website at [hackasaurus.org][].

  [hackasaurus.org]: http://hackasaurus.org

## Prerequisites

You need Python version 2.6 or higher. All other dependencies are
self-contained within the project's code repository.

## Setup

Just run this at the terminal prompt:

    cd hackasaurus.org
    python manage.py runserver

Then, point your browser to http://localhost:8000/.

## Development

All static, unlocalized files are in the `static` directory, which are
placed at the root of the web site. The `templates` directory
contains localized [Jinja2][] templates that are located at `/<locale>/` on
the web site, where `<locale>` is the name of a locale like `en-US`.

Whenever you need to link to a localized template, you can do so either via
a relative URL or an absolute one that begins with the template variable
`{{ LOCALE_ROOT }}`.

## Testing

When writing JavaScript code, please try to make it testable and add
a unit test for it in the `test` directory. These [QUnit][] tests can be
run from the development server at [localhost:8000/test][].

  [localhost:8000/test]: http://localhost:8000/test/

## Localization

The site uses GNU gettext for localization via [Babel][] and Jinja2's
[i18n extension][]. Soon we'll get the site listed on
[localize.mozilla.org][] so that anyone can easily help localize
the website.

  [Babel]: http://babel.edgewall.org/
  [i18n extension]: http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/templates/#extensions
  [localize.mozilla.org]: https://localize.mozilla.org

## Deployment

Run this at the terminal prompt:

    python manage.py build
    
This will create a static version of the site, for all supported locales, in 
the `dist` directory. You can copy this directory to any web server that 
serves static files, such as Apache or Amazon S3.

## Technical Design Philosophy

The Hackasaurus website is almost entirely static content, so we didn't see
much of a need to use a massive server-side framework like [Playdoh][].
Instead, we took an approach more akin to that of [Jekyll][], whereby
a script can be run to generate a fully static site capable of being
deployed to any static web server.

However, we pick from Playdoh's toolkit when we need to solve a problem, which
results in a code repository that looks more familiar to Mozilla developers as
the site's requirements become more complex.

## Security

These major known vulnerabilities ought to be fixed before any sensitive
information is served from the domain this site is hosted on:

1. On the events page, we load a [Lanyrd Badge][] via HTTP script injection.
   The secure equivalent of the script's URL doesn't deliver a trusted
   certificate, so loading the badge over HTTPS may be problematic.
