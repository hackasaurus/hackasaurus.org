	<h1>Building a generation of webmakers</h1>

	<img class="pullout" src="/include/image/photo-hackers-01.jpg" alt="Photo of some Hackasaurus workshop attendees" />
	
	<p>Hackasaurus spreads skills, attitudes and ethics that help youth thrive in a remixable digital world. By making it easy for youth to tinker and mess around with the building blocks that make up the web, Hackasaurus helps tweens move from digital consumers to active producers, seeing the web as something they can actively shape, remix and make better.</p>
	
	<h2>Through a set of easy-to-use tools&hellip;</h2>
	
	<p>Hackasaurus tools make it easy for kids to remix, create and share on the web. The X-Ray Goggles allow learners to see what the web is made of, remix and change their favorite web pages, and share their creations with friends. WebPad makes it easy to take the next step, creating your own web pages in a matter of seconds. And the Hackbook provides bits of code for easy copying and pasting, making it easy to play with the web like lego.</p>

	<h2>&hellip;and at "hack jam" events around the world.</h2>
	
	<img class="pullout" src="/include/image/photo-hackers-02.jpg" alt="photo-hackers-02" />
	
	<p>Hack jams make hacking and digital literacy accessible, social and fun. In partnership with libraries, learning centers and youth media centers, learners take part in a flexible DIY curriculum of hands-on projects and making.  Building off pilot events run by the Learning Network in New York and Chicago, the upcoming Hackasaurus Event Kit will make it easy for anyone, anywhere to organize their own jam.</p>
	
	<h2>Remixing and tinkering with your favorite web sites</h2>
	
	<p>Instead of using "kid-ified" sandboxes or artifical languages, Hackasaurus lets youth hack using familiar web pages and real HTML. This allows them to remix the spaces they already hang out in, and turns the web itself into a giant learning environment. Learners come away with fundamentals like HTML and CSS skills, web browser and add-on basics, prototyping and iterative design, and understanding the web’s conceptual building blocks.</p>
	
	<h2>Gaining webmaker skills for the digital world</h2>
	
	<p>Beyond technical knowledge, Hackasaurus helps develop "hacker habits" -- the combination of technical and social skills youth need to become active co-creators, shape their environments, and take charge of their own learning.</p>

		<h2>History</h2>

		<h3>May 2011</h3>
		
		<p>On the 8th, Jessica Klein and Tristan Surman host a hack jam at Mini Maker Faire Toronto, where they deploy new tools that allow kids to <a href="http://hackasaurus.github.com/hackasaurus-print/">print their hacks</a> and share "hack replicas", which are fully self-contained copies of hacked pages. An example of the latter is <a href="http://hackasaurus.github.com/hackasaurus-print/?photo_id=5695772815">Beas Search Site</a>.</p>
		<p>On the 12th, Atul prototypes a new feature in the goggles called <em>Tear-Out Page</em>, which provides the user with HTML source code for the current state of the page being viewed/remixed. The feature is intended to make it easier to bridge the gap between the goggles and full-on HTML editing using sites like <a href="http://htmlpad.org/">HTMLpad</a> and <a href="http://jsbin.com/">JS Bin</a>. It also makes it easier to share one's hacks.</p>

		<h3>April 2011</h3>
		
		<p>On the 21st, Jessica Klein and Chris Lawrence host a hack jam at the New York Hall of Science, which they chronicle in <a href="http://jessicaklein.blogspot.com/2011/04/earth-day-my-carbon-footprint-3d-design.html">The Earth Day My Carbon Footprint 3D Design Hack Jam for Youth at the New York Hall of Science</a>. At this jam, a new sharing add-on was deployed which made it easy for participants to upload screenshots of their hacks to Flickr. An example of a hack made and shared at this jam is <a href="http://hackasaurus.github.com/hackasaurus-print/?photo_id=5644398032">Failbook</a>.</p>		
		
		<h3>March 2011</h3>
		
		<p>From the 3rd through the 5th, the Hackasaurus team storms DML and presents the project at a science fair booth, an interactive workshop, and the ignite presentation. Matt creates concise messaging for the project and writes about it in his post <a href="http://openmatt.wordpress.com/2011/03/03/hackasaurus-attacks-long-beach/">Hackasaurus attacks Long Beach</a>. Solo missions introducing users to the goggles are used for the first time at the DML workshop.</p>
		
		<h3>February 2011</h3>
		
		<p>From the 9th to the 11th, Chris, Jack, Jessica, and Atul lead a series of three inaugural hack jams at branches of the New York Public Library in Manhattan and the Bronx. The first jam involves paper prototyping and use of the goggles, while the next two introduce HTMLpad and a <a href="/include/document/2011-02-10-htmlpad-mission.html">top secret mission</a> by Ben. MacArthur’s <em>Spotlight on Digital Media and Learning</em> covers the events in their article <a href="http://spotlight.macfound.org/featured-stories/entry/at-hackasaurus-jam-mozilla-encourages-young-programmers-to-change-the-web/">At Hackasaurus Jam, Mozilla Encourages Young Programmers to Change the Web</a>.</p>
		<p>On the 17th, Atul and Taylor lead a hack jam at YouMedia Chicago. At this point, basic remix functionality has been added to the goggles, which kids react positively towards. Atul catalogues this in a Google Group post titled <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/hackasaurus/browse_thread/thread/11834680e7d05b9b#">Notes from the Feb 17 jam at YouMedia</a>. The event was later covered in a MacArthur video and story entitled <a href="http://spotlight.macfound.org/studentspeak/entry/Using-Goggles-to-Change-Google-Teens-Power-of-Programming-at-Mozillas-Hac/">Using Goggles to Change Google: Teens Learn the Power of Programming at Mozilla’s Hackasaurus</a>.</p>
		<p>On the 22nd, at a Bay Area Video Coalition jam for Web Made Movies in San Francisco, the Hackasaurus tools are used to introduce teens to the basics of HTML before they dive into using Web Made Movie tools. Afterwards, Ben blogs about <a href="http://www.benmoskowitz.com/?p=161">Three "Aha!" Moments with BAVC’s Factory program</a>.</p>
		<p>Towards the end of the month, the Hackasaurus team prepares an ignite talk to present at MacArthur’s Digital Media and Learning Conference. Matt blogs about this in his post entitled <a href="http://openmatt.wordpress.com/2011/02/28/hackasaurus-getting-ready-for-the-digital-media-learning-conference/">Hackasaurus: getting ready for the DML Conference</a>.

		<h3>December 2010</h3>
		
		<p>On the 7th, Jessica and Atul create the <a href="/include/document/2010-12-07-googledoc/">12-07 Google Doc</a> containing wireframes for the remix interface, as well as the first references to Hanging Out, Messing Around, and Geeking Out.</p>
		<p>The next day, Ingrid, Ben, Jack, Chris, Taylor, Jessica, Rafi, and Atul discuss the document and keep notes at the <a href="/include/document/2010-12-08-etherpad.html">12-08 Etherpad</a>.</p>
		<p>Near the end of the month, Jessica and Atul set up infrastructure for the project including a <a href="https://github.com/hackasaurus">GitHub organization</a>, a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/hackasaurus/">Flickr group pool</a>, a <a href="http://hackasaurus.lighthouseapp.com/">Lighthouse project</a>, a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/hackasaurus/">Google Group</a>, and more.</p>
		<p>On the 29th, Jessica creates the first <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jessicaklein/5304472723/in/pool-1590086@N21/">Hackasaurus mascot</a>.</p>

		<h3>November 2010</h3>
		
		<p>During the <a href="http://learningfreedomandtheweb.org/">Drumbeat Festival</a>, Taylor, Jack and Atul develop a tentative curriculum for a Web inspection+remix tool in public libraries and document it at the <a href="include/document/2010-11-05-etherpad.html">11-05 Etherpad</a>.</p>
		<p>On the 22nd, Taylor presents on the project at the weekly Drumbeat meeting and much brainstorming occurs at the <a href="/include/document/2010-11-22-etherpad.html">11-22 Etherpad</a>. This is the first time <i>Hackasaurus</i> is used to describe the project.</p>
		<p>Late in the month, Atul creates a prototype for an inspection tool he calls <a href="https://secure.toolness.com/webxray/">Web X-Ray Goggles</a>; in early December he adds a 4-minute introductory screencast.</p>

		<h3>October 2010</h3>
		
		<p>Atul and Mark discuss the value of teaching kids HTML to make web pages. Creating things from scratch can be intimidating for kids; perhaps creating tools and curriculum to empower kids to remix and modify the existing Web they live in every day would be more useful.</p>
		
		<h3>July 2010</h3>
		
		<p>On July 16, Mark Surman, Atul, Ingrid, Taylor, Jack, and a number of others meet at the Macarthur Foundation headquarters in Chicago to discuss the possibility of integrating <a href="http://commonspace.wordpress.com/2009/05/28/what-makes-the-web-better/">Open Web preservation</a> education into the pilot YOUmedia and NYPL initiatives. No artifacts exist from this meeting, but the notion of Atul teaching YOUmedia kids how to write HTML comes up, which leads Atul to create HTMLPad and blog about it in his post <a href="http://www.toolness.com/wp/?p=1107">Prelude to Barcelona</a>.</p>
