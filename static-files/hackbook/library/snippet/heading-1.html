&lt;h1&gt;All about Narwhals&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narwhals are whales that live in the Arctic. They have a single helical tusk and swim at depths of up to 1500m.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Narwhal's tusk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is believed the purpose of the Narwhal's tusk is to determine social rank. Narwhals have rarely been seen using their tusk for fighting or breaking sea ice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Population&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are estimated to be around 75,000 Narwhals in the wild, and they are a near threatened species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Conservation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narwhals are one of the most vulnerable arctic marine animals to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Threats&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only predators to Narwhals besides humans are polar bears and killar whales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Narwhal diet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diet of the Narwhal is very restricted. They prey on halibut, cod, shrimp and squid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Narwhal feeding habits&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narwhals feed in deep water, and congregate in groups of five to ten.

&lt;h4&gt;Diving&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narwhals are excellent divers and make some of the deepest dives ever recorded for marine mammals.&lt;/p&gt;
