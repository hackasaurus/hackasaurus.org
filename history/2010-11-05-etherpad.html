<h1>2010-11-05 Etherpad</h1>
<p>This is an etherpad that Taylor, Jack and Atul made on the last day of the Drumbeat Festival to explain the "sample use case" for Hackasaurus, which would presumably be a session led by Taylor at the YOUmedia center, or Jack at NYPL.</p>

Motivation<br
/>----------<br
/><br
/>Digital Citizenship: How do we help kids understand that the Web is mutable, and that it's whatever they make it to be?<br
/><br
/>Prerequisites<br
/>-------------<br
/><br
/>* Proficiency in Aviary (Web-based graphics editing program)<br
/>* Knowledge of basic Web browser use, including:<br
/>&nbsp; * copy/paste<br
/>&nbsp; * URLs<br
/><br
/>Things to Learn<br
/>---------------<br
/><br
/>Note that this is just one activity teaching one particular aspect of HTML. A similar framework can be used to teach other aspects.<br
/><br
/>* HTML<br
/>&nbsp; * How HTML is constructed and how the language works.<br
/>&nbsp; * Basics of what a tag is and how it's reflected on the rendered page.<br
/>&nbsp; * Specifically, an understanding of the &lt;img src=""&gt; tag.<br
/><br
/>The Activity<br
/>------------<br
/><br
/>Many possible activities:<br
/><br
/>* Change an ad.<br
/>* Change the font of some existing text.<br
/>* Change the color of some existing text.<br
/>* Chsnge/add a background image to a page or part of one.<br
/><br
/>We focused on changing an ad.<br
/><br
/>!. Find 5 websites with really annoying ads.<br
/>2. Show an instructor-hacked webpage, w/ a cool "ad" (or art, or something else interesting) replacing a lame one.<br
/>3. Select one of the websites with an annoying ad (perhaps the most annoying one).<br
/>4. Think about what kind of ad/art you want to replace it with.<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp; Consider focusing on something that you're passionate about, or think is important: a social issue, etc.<br
/><br
/>5. Figure out the image dimensions of the image they're replacing.<br
/>6. Go to the aviary to design the new ad, and make it.<br
/>7. Use the supplied awesome "X-ray vision hacker tool" to replace the ad.<br
/>8. Tell friends about the ad you changed; have them visit the website with the ad on their own computer and see the ad changed. You just hacked the internet!!<br
/><br
/>Outcomes<br
/>--------<br
/><br
/>* Kid understands basic structure of a web page.<br
/>* Media literacy: understanding what advertising is, the thrust/purpose, meaning/message behind it.<br
/>* Searching skills.<br
/>* Hope-for: now that the kid understands that the web is hackable, they dig deeper. perhaps they ultimately geek out, learn javascript and greasemonkey and how to make browser add-ons.<br
/>* Community learning+sharing: are the kids going to give feedback/criticism to each other, etc?<br
/>
