      <h2>Building a generation of webmakers</h2>
      <p> Hackasaurus spreads skills, attitudes, and ethics that help youth thrive in a remixable digital world. 
      By making it easy for youth to tinker and mess around with the building blocks that make up the web, Hackasaurus
      helps tweens move from digital consumers to active producers, seeing the web as something they can actively
      shape, remix and make better. </p>
      <h2>Through a set of easy to use tools</h2>
      <p>Hackasaurus tools make it easy for kids to remix, create and share on the web. The X-Ray Goggles allow 
      learners to see what the web is made of, remix and change their favorite web pages, and share their creations
      with friends.</p>
      <h2>..And at Hack Jam events around the world</h2>
      <p>Hack jams make hacking and digital literacy accessible, social and fun. In partnership with libraries, 
      learning centers and youth media centers, learners take part in a flexible DIY curriculum of hands-on projects and 
      making. Building off pilot events run by the Learning Network in New York and Chicago, the upcoming Hackasaurus Event Kit
      will make it easy for anyone, anywhere to organize their own jams.</p>
